					"Prognostic Models for Sepsis Built on Small Datasets." </a> Submitted 2022 </li>
				<br>
				ABSTRACT: Background and Objectives: Sepsis is one of the common causes of death in intensive care units. A reliable prognostic model based on patients’ data of relevant indicators would enable clinicians to make treatment decisions to improve clinical outcomes for septic patients. This study aims to develop a machine-learning framework for developing such prognostic tools by exploring the class-imbalanced longitudinal data of a small group of septic patients.
Methods: An engineered input dataset is devised in the form of concatenated triples to increase the data size relative to the dimension of the variable or feature space. Each concatenated triplet consists of a patient’s static data, the k-day consecutively longitudinal data, and the clinical outcome (k=2,3,4,5). The structured input data are then used to train classifiers in combination with appropriate feature engineering techniques. The trained classifiers are validated on a new dataset to ensure their clinical efficacy. We implement the modeling approach using five classifiers: K nearest neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) coupled with a set of feature engineering techniques. AUROC and a new metric, γ, made up of the F1 score on the external validation set, are used to assess the efficacy of the models.
Results: Five prognostic models are built on the engineered input dataset accounting for 10 selected dynamic features, in which XGBoost (AUROC=0.777, F1 score=0.694) and RF (AUROC=0.769, F1 score=0.647) combined with the ensemble under-sampling strategy outperform their peers in the external validation. This study shows that the developed framework can greatly improve the accuracy and generalizability of standard classifiers. The improvement in (AUROC, overfitting) are (6.66%, 54.96%) and (0.52%, 77.72%) for RF and XGBoost, respectively, over the two models without feature engineering.
Conclusion: A new modeling framework is devised to develop prognostic tools for septic patients concerning their mortality using small, class-imbalanced, and high-dimensional datasets. It enables standard classifiers to use small datasets to achieve relatively high predictability by engineering new structured datasets encoded with temporal features, sampling strategies, and dimension reduction techniques, providing clinically useful prognostic models and setting an example for applying machine learning methods to small data problems in medicine.

				Indices of Cancer Patients Using Patient-Specific Deep Learning Models." </a>
				Journal of Personalized Medicine 12, no. 5 (2022): 742.</li>
				<br>
				Abstract: We develop a patient-specific dynamical system model from the time series data of the cancer patient’s metabolic panel taken during the period of cancer treatment and recovery. The model consists of a pair of stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks and a fully connected neural network in each unit. It is intended to be used by physicians to trace back and look forward at the patient’s metabolic indices, to identify potential adverse events, and to make short-term predictions. When the model is used in making short-term predictions, the relative error in every index is less than 10% in the L∞ norm and less than 6.3% in the L1 norm in the validation process. Once a master model is built, the patient-specific model can be calibrated through transfer learning. As an example, we obtain patient-specific models for four more cancer patients through transfer learning, which all exhibit reduced training time and a comparable level of accuracy. This study demonstrates that this modeling approach is reliable and can deliver clinically acceptable physiological models for tracking and forecasting patients’ metabolic indices.

				ABSTRACT: Cationic cobaltocenium derivatives are promising components of the anion exchange membranes because of their excellent thermal and alkaline stability under the operating conditions of a fuel cell. Here, we present an efficient modeling approach to assessing the chemical stability of substituted cobaltocenium CoCp2+,basedonthecomputedelectronic structure enhanced by machine learning techniques. Within the aqueous environment, the positive charge of the metal cation is balanced by the hydroxide anion through formation of the CoCp2+OH− complexes, whose dissociation is studied within the implicit solvent employing the density functional theory. The data set of about 118 the CoCp2+OH− complexes based on 42 substituent groups characterized by a range of electron-donating (ED) and electron-withdrawing (EW) properties is constructed and analyzed. Given 12 carefully chosen chemistry-informed descriptors of the complexes and relevant fragments, the stability of the complexes is found to strongly correlate with the energies of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, modulated by a switching function of the Hirshfeld charge. The latter is used as a measure of the electron-withdrawing−donating character of the substituents. On the basis of this observation from the conventional regression analysis, two fully connected, feed-forward neural network (FNN) models with different unit structures, called the chemistry-informed (CINN) and the quadratic (QNN) neural networks, together with a support vector regression (SVR) model are developed. Both deep neural network models predict the bond dissociation energies of the cobaltocenium complexes with mean relative errors less than 10.56% and average absolute errors less than 1.63 kcal/mol, superior to the conventional regression and the SVR model prediction. The results show the potential of QNN to efficiently capture more complex relationships. The concept of incorporating the domain (chemical) knowledge/insight into the neural network structure paves the way to applications of machine learning techniques with small data sets, ultimately leading to better predictive models compared to the classical machine learning method SVR and conventional regression analysis.

				<br>ABSTRACT: Metallocenium cations, used as a component in an anion exchange membrane of a fuel cell, demonstrate excellent thermal and alkaline stability, which can be improved by the chemical modification of the cyclopentadienyl rings with substituent groups. In this work, the relation between the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the cobaltocenium (CoCp2+) derivatives, used as a measure of the cation stability, and chemistry-informed descriptors obtained from the electronic structural calculations is established. The analysis of 12 molecular descriptors for 118 derivatives reveals a nonlinear dependence of the BDE on the electron donating-withdrawing character of the substituent groups coupled to the energy of the frontier molecular orbitals. A chemistry-informed feed-forward neural network trained using k-fold cross-validation over the modest data set is able to predict the BDE from the molecular descriptors with the mean absolute error of about 1 kcal/mol. The theoretical analysis suggests some promising modifications of cobaltocenium for experimental research. The results demonstrate that even for modest data sets the incorporation of the chemistry knowledge into the neural network architecture, e.g., through mindful selection and screening of the descriptors and their interactions, paves the way to gain new insight into molecular properties.
