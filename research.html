### Research Interests
 * Data-driven discovery of dynamic system and pdes and its' applications.
 * Phase field model: Allen Cahn equation and Cahn Hilliard equation.
 * Structure preserving methods: asymptotic preserving method, energy stable method. 
 
### Community Activities
I'm currently co-organizing(together with [Hamori, Thomas](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/our_people/directory/hamori_thomas.php) and [Black, McKenzie](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/our_people/directory/black_mckenzie.php)) the [ACM Student Seminar](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/beyond_classroom/colloquia_and_seminars/acm_seminar/index.php) in Department of Mathematics. Please contact us if you'd like to give a talk!
