**Abstract** We introduce a novel adaptive refinement strategy—the Energy Dissipation Rate-based Adaptive Sampling (EDRAS)—that significantly enhances the performance of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in solving thermodynamically consistent equations across arbitrary domains. EDRAS leverages energy dissipation rate density as a strategic metric for identifying and resampling critical collocation points, fundamentally improving solution accuracy in PINNs. We demonstrate EDRAS's effectiveness by solving an Allen-Cahn phase field model with dynamic boundary conditions. Our results show that EDRAS achieves a sixfold reduction in relative mean square error compared to traditional residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) methods. Through detailed analysis of disk and ellipse-shaped 2D domains, we investigate how dynamic boundary conditions, in contrast to static ones, influence the system's bulk dynamics. This work makes two key contributions: it establishes EDRAS as a powerful enhancement to PINNs for thermodynamically consistent systems, and it provides novel insights into the crucial relationship between dynamic boundary conditions and bulk dynamics in thermodynamic systems. The resulting computational framework offers a robust approach for studying complex thermodynamic systems in arbitrary geometries.
